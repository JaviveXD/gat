He is an agent of the Daidoji Faction, the former fourth chairman of the Tojo Clan, the former manager of Morning Glory Orphanage, and a former taxi driver for Nagasu Taxi. Kiryu's legendary accomplishments and ascent through the ranks of the Tojo Clan's Dojima Family, as well as the dragon tattoo on his back, have earned him the nickname "The Dragon of Dojima" (堂島の龍, Dōjima no Ryū)1.</p></div>
